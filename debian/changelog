speech-tools (1:1.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eek!  ESD support is kind of broken.  I've left it in, since I hope to
    fix it soon, but now the tools default to using a non-network audio
    protocol instead (which I think is more generally useful).

speech-tools (1:1.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Urgh ... update the shlibs file; since we moved some templates from
    Festival in here, it needs to depend on this version or higher.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Apr 2001 15:18:06 -0400

speech-tools (1:1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Not using DBS anymore due to newfound knowledge of and influence over
    the EST/Festival configuration and build process.
  * Now installs configuration tree in /usr/lib/speech_tools/config/ where
    Festival (and other things like forthcoming Perl bindings, Festvox,
    etc) can find it.  (part of the justification for doing the above)
  * Should compile on everything now due to a more intelligent system.sh
    (backported from 1.2.2 beta)
  * Add basic manual pages for na_record, na_play, ch_wave, ch_utt
    (these should actually be auto-generated for all programs, but
    unfortunately the system only does SGML evil)
  * Header files moved to /usr/include/speech_tools/, which seems like a
    better location for them.
  * No longer compiled against NAS (adds too many extra library
    dependencies, and isn't generally useful).
  * Patched na_record to support an -audiodevice parameter (also from
    1.2.2 beta)
  * Actually include na_record in speech-tools-bin (duh!)
  * Instantiate some templates that Festival wants, to reduce the evil.
  * Apply serverdiphfdfix.patch and merge voxware.cc changes from
    http://festvox.org/packed/festival/1.4.1/PATCHES.

  * Fixed a foible in debian/rules that caused the *.so links to be
    created in the wrong package, yuck.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Nov 1999 23:35:27 -0500

festival (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  Is now free software.  Hooray.
  * Change in source format - festival and speech-tools now build from a
    single source package again, using Adam Heath's most excellent build
    system.  This allows me to eliminate many (but not all) of the nasty
    hacks previously needed to build this package.  An unfortunate side
    effect of this is that the version number of the debian package for
    speech-tools does not reflect the actual upstream numbering system.
    This is due to Festival and Speech-Tools having a build system that is
    designed with the intent that the packages will be built under the
    same directory together and installed in place.  As the authors state,
    this reflects the purpose of Festival as a research system.  It does,
    however, make life very difficult when trying to produce a
    distributable and policy-compliant Debian package.
  * Most of the documentation is in the festival-doc package now.  This is
    from the prebuilt festdoc package provided upstream, as it appears to
    be quite impossible to build the docs without a specially modified
    version of doc++ (boooooo)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 20:05:18 -0500

festival (1.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now installs festival.el properly.  Also, did s/stml/sable/g.  Run
    "say-minor-mode" to get a nice menu for reading your buffers.
  * Also builds info documentation (this creates a rather nasty source
    dependency on the voice packages, which I'll try to fix ASAP)
  * Also builds C++ API documentation in HTML.
  * Renamed ppc_Linux.mak to powerpc_Linux.mak (doh!)
  * Work around some RXP weirdness with respect to the location of the
    Sable DTD.  (a real fix will have to wait until a standalone RXP is
    packaged and we can link against it)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Fri, 28 May 1999 00:15:49 -0400

festival (1.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    automagically with Emacs, nsgmls, and the like.
