.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ch_track
copies an input track file to an output track file, optionally performing
various operations along the way.
.Pp
The following option flags are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent -compact
.It Fl h
Print a short summary of options to standard output.
.It Fl itype Ar file type
Input file type (optional). If no type is specified, type is automatically
derived from the input file's header. The list of supported types may depend on
your particular Speech Tools installation. For a full listing, see the output of
the
.Fl h
option.
.It Fl ctype Ar F0 | track
Contour type, either F0 (fundamental frequency) or track.
.It Fl s Ar time
Frame spacing of input in seconds, for unheadered input file.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Select a subset of channels (starting from 0). Tracks can have multiple
channels.  This option specifies a list of channel numbers which are to be used
for processing.
.It Fl start Ar time
Extract track starting at this time, specified in seconds.
.It Fl end Ar time
Extract track ending at this time, specified in seconds.
.It Fl from Ar frame
Extract track starting at this offset, specified in frames.
.It Fl to Ar frame
Extract track ending at this offset, specified in frames.
.It Fl o Ar file
Filename to write output to.  Defaults to standard output.
.It Fl otype Ar file type
Output file type. If unspecified, ascii is assumed. For the full list of
supported types, see the output of the
.Fl h
option.
.It Fl S Ar time
Frame spacing of output in seconds. If this is different from the input
spacing, the contour will be resampled.
.It Fl info
Print information about the input file and its headers. This option gives useful
information such as file length, file type, and channel names. No other actions
are taken, and no output file produced.
.It Fl track_names Ar file
File containing new names for output channels
.It Fl diff
Differentiate contour. This performs simple numerical differentiation on the
contour by subtracting the amplitude of the current frame from the amplitude of
the next.  Although quick, this technique is crude and not recommended as the
estimation of the derivate is done on only one point.
.It Fl delta Ar length
Make delta coefficients (better form of differentiation). The argument to this
option is the regression length of the delta calculation and can be between 2
and 4.
.It Fl sm Ar time
Length of smoothing window in seconds. Various types of smoothing are available
for tracks. This option specifies length of the smoothing window which affects
the degree of smoothing, i.e. a longer value means more smoothing.
.It Fl smtype Ar median | mean
Type of smoothing.
.It Fl style Ar style
Convert track to another form.  Currently only one form, "label", is supported.
This uses a specified cutoff to make a label file, with two labels, one for
above the cutoff (see the
.Fl pos
option), and one for below (see the
.Fl neg
option).
.It Fl t Ar threshold
Threshold for track to label conversion.
.It Fl neg Ar label
Name of negative label in track to label conversion.
.It Fl pos Ar label
Name of positive label in track to label conversion.
.It Fl pc Ar longest | first
Combind given tracks in parallel. If option is "longest", pad shorter tracks to
longest, else if "first", pad or cut them as appropriate to match the length of
the first input track.
